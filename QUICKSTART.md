# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide - Battery ROI Calculator

## Installation (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Download the files
You should have these files:
- `app.py` - Backend server
- `battery_simulator.py` - Simulation engine
- `index.html` - Web interface
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `start.sh` - Startup script
- `sample_tibber_data.csv` - Example data
- `README.md` - Full documentation
- `HARDWARE_DESIGN.md` - Dongle design

### Step 2: Install Python dependencies

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Step 3: Open the web interface
1. Open your browser
2. Open `index.html` (double-click or drag into browser)
3. The interface will connect to `http://localhost:5000`

## Using the Application

### Get Your Tibber Data
1. Open Tibber app on your phone
2. Go to "AnvÃ¤ndning" (Usage)
3. Tap "Exportera" (Export)
4. Select date range (12 months recommended)
5. Download CSV file
6. Upload to the web app

### Configure Your System

**Battery Settings:**
- Choose a preset (Tesla Powerwall, Huawei Luna, etc.)
- Or enter custom capacity (kWh) and power (kW)
- Enter the cost of your battery system

**Network Operator:**
- Select your nÃ¤tbolag from the list
- Or enter custom grid fees and effect tariff

**Solar (Optional):**
- Enter your solar panel capacity in kWp
- Leave at 0 if you don't have solar panels

**StÃ¶dtjÃ¤nster (Optional):**
- Click "Uppskatta FCR-N" to estimate revenue
- The app will calculate if your battery qualifies
- Add the estimated revenue to see impact on ROI

### View Results
The app will show:
- âœ… Payback period in years
- ðŸ’° Annual savings in SEK
- ðŸ“Š Monthly breakdown
- ðŸ’¡ Personalized insights and recommendations
- ðŸ“ˆ ROI percentage and NPV

## Test with Sample Data

Want to test first? Use the included `sample_tibber_data.csv`:
1. Upload this file
2. Use default settings:
   - Battery: 10 kWh, 5 kW, 80,000 SEK
   - Grid fee: 0.45 SEK/kWh
   - Effect tariff: 50 SEK/kW/month
   - Solar: 10 kWp
3. Click "BerÃ¤kna ROI"

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" error
- Make sure Flask server is running (`python app.py`)
- Check that port 5000 is not blocked by firewall
- Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health` in browser

### "No module named 'flask'" error
- Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### CSV upload fails
- Make sure CSV has these columns: timestamp, consumption, spot price
- File should be UTF-8 encoded
- Swedish column names: "FrÃ¥n", "FÃ¶rbrukning", "Spotpris"
- Or English: "timestamp", "consumption_kwh", "spot_price_sek_kwh"

### Results seem unrealistic
- Check that your grid fees are correct for your area
- Verify battery cost includes installation
- Make sure effect tariff is per kW per month (not per year)
- Solar capacity should be in kWp (not total annual production)

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Real Data**: At least 12 months of Tibber data
2. **Accurate Costs**: Include installation in battery cost
3. **Check Your Tariffs**: Verify with your nÃ¤tbolag
4. **Solar Production**: Use actual installed capacity
5. **Consider StÃ¶dtjÃ¤nster**: Can improve ROI by 20-40%

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use this with any battery brand?**
A: The calculator works with any battery. The dongle (hardware) supports most brands via Modbus.

**Q: Will this work in other Nordic countries?**
A: The calculator is designed for Sweden but can be adapted for Norway, Denmark, Finland with different tax rates and grid fees.

**Q: How accurate are the predictions?**
A: Historical simulations are very accurate (based on real data). Future predictions depend on weather and consumption patterns.

**Q: Can I sell the dongles commercially?**
A: Yes! The code is MIT licensed. See `HARDWARE_DESIGN.md` for business model suggestions.

**Q: Does this void my battery warranty?**
A: The dongle only reads data (doesn't control the battery), which is generally safe and doesn't void warranties.

**Q: How much can I really save?**
A: Typical savings are 15-30% on electricity costs. With stÃ¶dtjÃ¤nster, add another 5,000-15,000 SEK/year.
