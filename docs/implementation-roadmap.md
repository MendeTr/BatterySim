## üöÄ Epic 0: Sigenergy 24h Planning Architecture (CURRENT PRIORITY)

**Goal:** Implement 24-hour proactive optimization inspired by Sigenergy's AI approach

**Background:** Previous attempts at peak shaving were reactive (hour-by-hour decisions). Sigenergy's analysis shows they plan the entire 24 hours at once when next-day prices are known (13:00 daily). This allows:
- Pre-positioning battery for known peak windows
- Charging at absolute cheapest hour (not just "cheap enough")
- Global optimization across 24 hours (not greedy local decisions)

**Reference Documents:**
- `docs/sigenai.txt` - Detailed analysis of Sigenergy's AI system
- `docs/Analysis_sig_vs_roi.txt` - Comparison of their approach vs ours
- `docs/sigenergy-24h-planning.md` - Implementation plan

| GPT API costs too high | Medium | Support algorithm fallback mode |
| Simulation takes too long (full year) | Low | Add progress streaming, partial saves |
| Historical patterns not predictive | High | Implement learning agent, adjust buffers |
| Orchestrator makes poor trade-offs | High | Add decision logging, manual review mode |

---

## Notes

- User has no solar panels currently (solar agent low priority)
- User's peaks are from household consumption during E.ON hours (06:00-23:00)
- Tesla charging happens at night (00:00-06:00, outside E.ON measurement)
- E.ON uses top-3 average method for effect tariff calculation
- Battery: 25 kWh Dyness Stack 100 + Solis 12 kW inverter
- Target grid import: 5 kW during E.ON hours
