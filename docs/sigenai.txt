AI Operation in Sigenergy Home Battery Systems

Sigenergy’s home battery storage solution (the SigenStor 5-in-1 system) is built around an AI-driven energy management system. This AI – often called Sigen AI or AI Mode in the mySigen app – actively optimizes how and when the battery charges or discharges to achieve three key goals:
	•	Peak Shaving: Reducing or shifting grid usage during high-cost peak periods.
	•	Energy Arbitrage: Taking advantage of price differences (charging when electricity is cheap, and discharging or even exporting when it’s expensive).
	•	Self-Consumption Optimization: Maximizing the use of on-site generation (like solar PV) within the home, rather than drawing from the grid or feeding energy back at low rates.

Below, we detail how Sigenergy’s AI manages each function and the decision logic behind it, including the data inputs (historical patterns, real-time tariffs, weather forecasts, etc.) and algorithms it employs.

AI-Driven Peak Shaving (Managing Peak Periods)

Sigenergy’s AI is designed to flatten your consumption during expensive peak hours. It learns your home’s typical daily load profile and identifies when your grid usage usually spikes. Using this knowledge, the system will pre-charge the battery during cheaper off-peak times and automatically switch the house to battery power during the peak-rate window ￼. In effect, the battery shaves off the peaks in demand by supplying stored energy when grid power cost is highest. This not only avoids drawing expensive electricity but also smooths out the home’s load curve (resulting in more predictable, lower bills) ￼.

Key points about peak shaving in Sigenergy’s AI mode:
	•	Time-of-Use Awareness: The AI is aware of your utility’s time-of-use or peak/off-peak schedule (you can input/select your tariff plan in the app). It strategically plans charging/discharging around these windows to minimize usage during peak periods ￼. For example, it might top up the battery in the early morning hours when rates are low, then use that energy to power the home in the evening peak.
	•	Historical Peak Patterns: Over time, the AI refines its understanding of when your home typically hits its highest demand. It uses historical consumption data (“your energy use patterns”) to anticipate peaks ￼. The longer the system runs, the more data it gathers – and Sigenergy claims the AI actually gets “smarter” at peak shaving the more it learns ￼. This suggests a machine learning element where the algorithm continuously adapts to your habits.
	•	Automatic Control: All of this happens automatically in AI mode. The user doesn’t need to manually trigger the battery at 5 PM, for instance – the AI will have already scheduled that discharge if it knows 5–7 PM is a peak price period. The mySigen app provides real-time visualization of this: you can see the battery discharging to supply the home during peaks and charging during low-rate hours on the live flow diagram.

In summary, for peak shaving the Sigenergy AI acts as an automated load manager: it minimizes grid draw when electricity is expensive by intelligently timing the battery’s charge/discharge cycles ￼. This directly cuts peak-period consumption from the grid, saving money and reducing strain on the grid during high demand.

AI Strategies for Energy Arbitrage (Buy Low, Use/Sell High)

One of the most powerful features of Sigenergy’s AI is performing energy arbitrage using the battery. The system analyzes electricity price signals in real time (or day-ahead, depending on the tariff) and makes economically optimal decisions on when to charge or discharge. In practice, this means charging the battery when power is cheap (or free) and discharging when power is expensive ￼. If your utility or market allows, it can even export stored energy back to the grid when prices spike to earn credits (or at least offset more expensive consumption). Here’s how it works:
	•	Dynamic Tariff Integration: Sigenergy has built its platform to support dynamic pricing schemes in many countries. According to the company, Sigen AI can ingest real-time or time-of-use pricing data and use it to schedule the battery’s operation optimally ￼. For example, with a tariff like Octopus Agile/Flux (which has different prices each half-hour), the AI will forecast which times will be cheapest to charge and when prices will be highest to discharge, then set a schedule accordingly. Sigenergy’s CEO Tony Xu notes that Sigen AI uses real-time pricing information as a key input to determine the best charge/discharge schedule for cost savings ￼. The system currently supports dynamic tariffs in over 20 countries, illustrating how it’s geared for arbitrage opportunities in diverse energy markets ￼.
	•	Automated Charge/Discharge for Profit: Using the pricing data, the AI will charge the battery during low-rate periods and then use that stored energy when rates rise, a classic “buy low, sell high” strategy ￼. In Sigenergy’s own description: “It charges your battery when prices are low and sells power when prices are high.” ￼. For instance, if power is only $0.10/kWh overnight but $0.40/kWh in the late afternoon, the system might charge up at 3 AM and then discharge around 5–8 PM to avoid those high costs (or even feed power back if net metering or feed-in tariffs make that profitable). All of this is handled by the AI’s scheduling logic without user intervention.
	•	Forecast-Backed Decisions: Importantly, the arbitrage logic doesn’t operate myopically hour-by-hour – it uses forecasts to plan ahead. The AI forecasts your future energy needs and the future solar production (using weather data – more on that below) along with known price forecasts. Using these, it effectively solves an optimization problem: maximize savings or profits over the coming day while meeting the home’s needs and respecting battery limits. The AI’s decision engine can be thought of as running through numerous scenarios or using algorithms to allocate the battery’s limited capacity to the most valuable times ￼. By considering the whole upcoming day, it avoids, for example, discharging too early and having no energy left for a later peak price, or over-charging and wasting solar potential. This strategic scheduling is a step beyond simple rules; Sigenergy highlights that AI-driven adaptation boosted savings dramatically in trials (up to ~44% extra savings in some cases) ￼. In one real case, a commercial user (a warehouse in Poland) using Sigen AI cut total energy costs by nearly 50% thanks to optimized arbitrage, achieved by the AI’s combination of price monitoring, consumption forecasting, and weather prediction ￼.
	•	User-Selectable Goals: Sigenergy’s AI mode even allows tailoring the objective. For example, some users report an AI setting for “Maximize Profit” versus other modes (like maximize self-use or backup reserve) in the app. In Max Profit mode, the AI leans heavily into arbitrage – prioritizing moves that yield monetary gain. It might aggressively export during peak price events or charge more from the grid when rates are extremely low (even if solar could charge the battery later), since the goal is purely economic. In contrast, a Self-Consumption mode might prioritize using solar energy over any grid trading (more on that next). These modes indicate that while the underlying algorithm is similar, it can weight decisions differently based on user preference (e.g. savings vs. green usage vs. backup). This flexibility is helpful to simulate, as you’d decide which objective function the AI is optimizing.

Overall, Sigenergy’s AI performs sophisticated energy arbitrage by marrying predictive analytics with real-time price data. It essentially runs your home battery like a miniature trading algorithm: forecast, plan, and execute the optimal charge/discharge plan to minimize costs or even generate value. All of this is done while maintaining supply to the home and respecting the battery’s constraints (capacity, depth-of-discharge limits, etc.). It’s a prime example of AI bringing automated decision-making to home energy management for financial optimization ￼ ￼.

Maximizing Self-Usage of Solar (Own-Consumption Optimization)

Another core function of Sigenergy’s AI is to maximize the use of on-site renewable generation – typically your solar PV output – within your home. This is often called self-consumption optimization or “own-usage” maximization. Instead of sending excess solar power to the grid (often at low feed-in rates) and later buying power back at higher rates, the goal is to use as much of that solar energy yourself as possible. Sigenergy’s AI accomplishes this through intelligent battery management and load timing:
	•	Solar Forecasting & Capture: The AI continuously checks weather forecasts to predict how much solar energy your panels will produce each day ￼. Using these forecasts (e.g. expecting a sunny vs. cloudy day), it will manage the battery to capture surplus solar generation. On a clear day, for example, the system knows there will likely be excess PV energy in midday hours. The AI will make sure the battery has enough empty capacity by that time (perhaps by discharging some in the early morning or not charging from the grid in late night) so that when your panels start exceeding your home’s immediate load, all that extra automatically goes into the battery instead of getting dumped to the grid. Sigenergy’s mySigen app explicitly notes that the AI “stores extra solar energy for times when the sun isn’t shining” ￼. This means during daylight the battery soaks up excess PV, and later the AI will discharge that stored solar power to supply the home at night or on a rainy afternoon – maximizing your use of the energy you generated.
	•	Minimizing Grid Imports: By doing the above, the AI ensures you draw as little from the grid as possible, especially during expensive periods. Essentially, the battery becomes a buffer to time-shift solar energy to whenever you need it. If your solar production on a given day can cover (say) 70% of your 24-hour consumption, the AI tries to help you actually use that 70% (instead of perhaps only 30–40% without storage) by clever timing. The net result is a higher self-sufficiency rate. Sigenergy often highlights that its system “maximises self-generated energy utilisation” ￼ – meaning the proportion of your solar that you consume yourself goes up, improving ROI on your solar investment and reducing reliance on the grid. In scenarios with low or zero feed-in tariffs, this is crucial for economics.
	•	Avoiding Solar Curtailment: In cases where the battery is full and loads are satisfied, excess solar would still go to the grid (the AI can’t create new load out of thin air). However, the AI tries to anticipate and avoid this waste by adjusting charging patterns. For instance, if a very sunny day is expected, the AI might use some battery energy earlier (even if grid prices aren’t high yet) simply to make room for the noon solar surge. Conversely, on a forecasted cloudy day, it might preserve battery charge (or even do a grid top-up) in the morning because it predicts there won’t be much solar later. This behavior shows the AI’s predictive optimization: it isn’t just reacting to solar as it comes, but actively planning around forecasted production.
	•	Coordination with Loads and EVs: Sigenergy’s ecosystem can also integrate an EV charger and other smart appliances. The AI can coordinate these to boost self-utilization. For example, if an EV is plugged in and midday solar is abundant, the AI could prioritize charging the EV directly from solar (as a form of “self-consumption” because it’s using on-site generation for on-site use). Similarly, the system could defer certain flexible loads to run when solar is active. While specifics on load control aren’t deeply documented, the AI scheduling certainly optimizes across all connected components (solar, battery, EV, grid) to maximize overall efficiency ￼. Sigenergy’s integrated approach (5-in-1 system with EMS) means the AI has visibility on all energy flows and can act holistically – e.g., deciding whether to put excess PV into the battery or into the EV or to power the house directly, depending on what yields the best usage of that energy.

In short, the AI’s own-usage optimization ensures your solar works for you as much as possible. By learning your production and consumption patterns, and leveraging forecasts, it intelligently balances where the solar energy goes – prioritizing your home and battery over grid export ￼. Users have noted significant improvements in self-sufficiency; instead of selling surplus solar at a low rate and later buying back at a premium, the AI’s strategy means you effectively “bank” your daytime solar into the battery and withdraw it when needed, with minimal wastage ￼. This not only saves money but also increases the renewable fraction of your home’s energy usage (a big win for sustainability goals).

How the AI Makes Its Decisions: Data Inputs & Learning Algorithms

To achieve the above functions, Sigenergy’s built-in AI relies on a combination of data streams, predictive models, and optimization algorithms. Understanding what data the AI uses and how it “thinks” is key to simulating such a system. Based on Sigenergy’s documentation and reports, here are the major inputs and decision-making methods:
	•	Historical Usage Patterns: The AI continuously learns from your home’s past energy behavior. It records your consumption patterns (hourly/daily usage trends, typical peaks, typical nighttime baseline, etc.) and uses this to predict future demand ￼ ￼. For example, it might learn that weekdays around 6pm your usage spikes as people return home, or that your electric heating kicks in early morning in winter. This historical data helps the AI anticipate loads for upcoming hours and days. Sigenergy explicitly says “Sigen AI learns from usage patterns” ￼ and that the longer it runs, the more accurate it gets. In simulation, this could be modeled via a machine learning forecast (like using a moving average or ML model that improves with more data) or even a simple approach that repeats typical days. The key is the AI isn’t static – it adapts to your routines (it “creates tailored energy plans that grow smarter over time” as one source notes ￼).
	•	Real-Time & Forecasted Pricing: Price signals are a crucial input. In markets with time-of-use (TOU) tariffs, the times and rates are known in advance (the AI is configured with these peak/off-peak rates). In dynamic pricing scenarios (like day-ahead hourly prices or real-time index prices), the system either receives a daily price schedule or continuously gets price updates from the cloud. Sigenergy’s platform (via SigenCloud and the app) supports importing these dynamic tariffs ￼. The AI uses current and upcoming prices to decide when charging or discharging yields the most benefit. We can think of this as the AI assigning a “value” to energy at different times: e.g. $0.50/kWh at 7pm vs $0.10/kWh at 2am – the battery will move energy from the low-value time to the high-value time. In simulation, you’d feed in a price timeline and the AI algorithm would schedule battery usage to arbitrage it. The importance of this input is highlighted by Sigenergy’s statement that “Sigen AI uses real-time pricing and dynamic tariffs as a guide to determine the best schedule” ￼.
	•	Weather and Solar Generation Forecasts: The AI pulls in weather data (likely via the cloud connection) to predict solar PV output and possibly temperature (which can affect home load, e.g. HVAC usage). Weather forecasting is explicitly mentioned as part of the AI’s brain: it “checks the weather forecast to predict how much solar energy your system is likely to generate” ￼. This allows the AI to plan charging around expected sunshine. For instance, before a cloudy day, it might charge the battery more from the grid (at off-peak) to ensure you have energy during a coming peak, since it knows solar won’t cover much. On a very sunny day, it might do the opposite and save room for solar charge. Weather input is critical for aligning the battery plan with reality – without it, the system might assume more or less solar than will occur, leading to suboptimal decisions. In a simulation, incorporating a solar PV forecast (even a simple one based on a known generation profile or random weather variability) would be necessary to emulate the AI’s planning.
	•	Machine Learning & Prediction Models: Under the hood, Sigenergy’s AI uses data analytics and machine learning models to make its predictions and decisions. The company describes Sigen AI as employing “cutting-edge data analytics and machine learning to predict and adapt to energy needs” ￼. This likely involves forecasting models for load and generation (which could be neural networks or other ML regression models trained on your data) and possibly reinforcement learning or optimization algorithms for deciding the charge/discharge actions. The AI essentially does two big tasks: forecast (what will solar and load be, what will prices be) and optimize (given those forecasts, how to operate the battery). The optimization could be solved with a rule-based expert system, but given Sigenergy’s emphasis on AI, it might be using more advanced techniques (even scenario-based or stochastic optimization, or an AI planner that simulates different strategies). We do know the system has a cloud component (“Device-Edge-Cloud” architecture ￼), meaning heavy computations can be done in the cloud. The local EMS can execute the plan in real-time, while cloud AI continuously improves the models. For simulation purposes, one could implement a simplified ML predictor (or use historical data directly for forecasting) and a solver (like linear programming to minimize cost subject to battery constraints).
	•	Continuous Learning and Adaptation: A defining trait of Sigen AI is that it continually learns and adapts. Multiple sources highlight that “the longer the system operates, the smarter it gets” ￼ and that it “creates energy plans that grow smarter over time”. In practice, this means the AI is not using a fixed schedule or static settings; it’s always updating its predictions with new data. For example, if your energy usage pattern changes (say you get an EV or start using electric heating more), the AI will detect the new patterns and adjust. If the tariff structure or weather patterns change seasonally, the AI adapts as well. This is very relevant to simulation: you could model the AI as updating its strategy after each day based on the error between its forecast vs actual or using a moving window of data. The self-learning aspect likely uses machine learning model updates or even an AI assistant. (Notably, Sigenergy even integrated a GPT-4 powered assistant in the app for explaining decisions and answering user questions ￼ ￼ – while that’s more about customer interface, it underscores how AI is at every layer of the system.)
	•	Edge and Cloud Architecture: Sigenergy designed the system with a “Device-Edge-Cloud” architecture ￼. This implies that some AI functions happen on the edge (locally in the controller/EMS for fast real-time control), while more computational or big-data analysis happens on cloud servers. For instance, real-time control like switching to battery during an outage or following the planned schedule likely runs on the local controller (ensuring immediate response and 0ms switchover via a patented control algorithm). Meanwhile, computing tomorrow’s optimal schedule or running a complex machine learning model might be done in the cloud and sent down to the device. The system requires an internet connection periodically to fetch data (prices, weather) and to update its algorithms – in fact, a reviewer noted that if the SigenStor goes offline for too long (beyond ~1 month), it will stop functioning until reconnected, highlighting how integral connectivity and cloud updates are ￼. When simulating, one might not split edge vs cloud, but it’s useful to know that in reality the AI has these distributed components for reliability and sophistication.

To put it all together, Sigenergy’s AI uses a blend of historical analysis, forecasting, and optimization. It takes past data (your usage history), present data (current battery/grid status and pricing signals), and future data (weather forecasts, tariff schedules) to make an informed plan. That plan is essentially an hour-by-hour (or finer) charging/discharging schedule for the battery over the next day (and perhaps a strategy for unexpected events). The AI then executes this plan, while remaining adaptive – if conditions change (say a sudden spike in usage or a cloud reduces solar output), the system can adjust in real time. According to Sigenergy, Sigen AI evaluates load forecasts, solar generation, and grid conditions in real time to optimize dispatch decisions ￼. In other words, it’s always re-checking and refining its actions as new data comes in.

For simulation purposes, one could model the AI decision loop in steps such as:
	1.	Forecast Generation & Load: Using historical patterns and weather input, predict the next 24 hours of solar production and home consumption.
	2.	Ingest Tariff Info: Retrieve the electricity price for each hour (peak/off-peak rates or dynamic prices).
	3.	Optimize Battery Schedule: Decide for each time block whether the battery should charge, discharge, or idle, to minimize cost (or maximize self-use), subject to battery constraints (capacity, power limits, required reserve for backup, etc.). This could be done via an optimization algorithm (e.g. linear programming that minimizes total cost = Σ (grid_import * price) given that grid_import can be reduced by battery discharge, etc.). The outcome might be a planned schedule like “Charge 2 kW from 2–4 AM, discharge 3 kW from 5–8 PM,” etc.
	4.	Execution with Feedback: As the day unfolds, measure actual solar and load vs. forecast. Adjust the plan if needed (e.g., if solar is over-performing, maybe charge the battery a bit earlier or push some energy to the evening). The AI could use closed-loop feedback to correct any deviations.
	5.	Learning Update: After the day, use the actual vs predicted data to refine the models. For example, if the forecast overestimated evening load, the AI “learns” and might adjust its model for next time. Over weeks, this training process makes the predictions and decisions increasingly accurate for that specific household.

Sigenergy doesn’t publicly detail the exact algorithms (those are proprietary), but the above logic aligns with descriptions from their marketing and interviews. They emphasize that AI brings real-time insights, intelligent automation, and personalized energy management to their system ￼. The personalization is key – the AI’s behavior for one household might differ from another’s based on what it has learned.

Supporting Information and Real-World Insights

To further illustrate how Sigenergy’s AI operates, here are a few additional insights and outcomes reported from both Sigenergy and actual users:
	•	Learning Period: Users have noted that Sigen AI may take around a week or two to “learn” the household after initial installation. During this period, it gathers baseline data. One user on a forum observed that “on the 7th day, the AI created its own profile and forecast”, indicating the system started making more autonomous decisions after about a week of data collection ￼. This suggests the AI might run a training routine over the first several days to calibrate its models. When simulating, one might include a training phase where initially the AI relies more on generic assumptions, then gradually tunes to actual data.
	•	Transparency via mySigen App: The AI’s actions are made transparent to the user through the mySigen mobile app. The app includes an “AI Insight” feature that shows why the AI made certain decisions and what it plans next ￼ ￼. For example, it might log: “Battery began charging at 2:00 AM because electricity was at off-peak pricing and the forecasted solar for tomorrow is low” – giving the rationale. It also shows a 24-hour forecast timeline of upcoming battery actions (charge/discharge events) with reasons (e.g. “will discharge at 7 PM due to high evening tariff”) ￼ ￼. This level of detail confirms that the AI indeed works on a forecast+plan basis (at least 24h ahead). For simulation, it means we can think in terms of daily planning cycles. The use of a GPT-4 based assistant in the app suggests that a large language model is employed to translate the raw data and decisions into human-friendly explanations ￼ – a nice touch but more about UX. Still, the underlying data (forecasts, schedule, etc.) is all there and can be part of the simulation output.
	•	Backup and Grid Outage Behavior: Although not directly about peak shaving/arbitrage, it’s worth noting the AI also considers backup power needs. Sigenergy’s system allows a “Battery Preserve” mode where a portion of capacity is reserved in case of a power outage ￼. In AI mode, the system likely balances this by not discharging 100% if storms or outages are likely (or if the user set a minimum state-of-charge for backup). The AI’s cloud platform (SigenCloud) monitors grid conditions and can react to demand-response events or emergencies ￼. For example, if a grid outage is detected or forecast (some advanced systems can use weather alerts to predict outages), the AI might temporarily override arbitrage and ensure the battery stays charged for resilience. While specific details aren’t given, a simulator could incorporate an “emergency reserve” constraint. Sigenergy did highlight that their AI-enabled Cloud BMS monitors battery health and can predict failures or issues for safety ￼, which is tangential but shows the AI ecosystem extends to maintenance and safety decisions as well.
	•	Performance Gains: Sigenergy often quantifies the benefits of their AI. They claim up to 44.56% additional savings in home energy costs on certain dates using Sigen AI, compared to not using the AI optimization ￼. They also mentioned a 900% improvement in some metric (possibly the speed or accuracy of adaptations, though the context isn’t fully clear from snippets). These figures underline that the AI isn’t just a gimmick – it can significantly change outcomes. In the Polish warehouse case, nearly 50% cost reduction was achieved, which was attributed to the AI’s intelligent handling of weather, consumption, and pricing data ￼. Essentially, Sigen AI can turn a battery system from a static backup device into an active money-saving (or even money-making) asset. When simulating, one could compare a baseline (no AI, maybe just generic schedule or only solar charging) vs. the AI-optimized strategy to see such improvements in action.
	•	User Feedback: Early adopters have generally been positive, noting that AI mode “works well” especially with agile tariffs, but some have faced minor quirks – for example, cases where the user wanted the AI to charge a bit more just in case of uncertain weather. In one anecdote, a user asked if they could tell the AI that it’s okay to charge an extra 1 kWh at end of off-peak “just in case the weather forecast is wrong” ￼. This highlights the inherent challenge of any AI forecasting system – it’s only as good as the data. Sigenergy’s approach, however, is to continually refine and even allow user input (you can always override or adjust settings). In simulation, one might consider the accuracy of the forecast and perhaps simulate occasional forecast errors to see how the AI would cope (e.g., it expected sun but a surprise storm hits – does the AI react by pulling from grid? Likely yes, it would then see battery draining faster and might charge from grid at the next cheapest slot).
	•	Integration with VPP and Grid Services: While the focus here is on home use, it’s worth noting Sigenergy’s AI is also built to participate in broader grid programs. The system supports Virtual Power Plant (VPP) integration, where the AI could decide to discharge at certain times not just for the user’s benefit but for grid support (if the user opts in) ￼. In these cases, the AI would incorporate external signals (like VPP dispatch commands or peak shaving at community level). For a home simulation this may be beyond scope, but it’s interesting as it shows the AI is fundamentally a general optimization engine for energy storage that can adapt to various goals (home savings, grid services, etc.) via software.
