Critical Differences: Sigenergy vs Your Approach
1. FORECASTING vs REACTIVE
Sigenergy (from sigen.txt):

Uses 24-hour ahead forecasting for consumption, solar, and prices
Plans the ENTIRE day at once (optimization problem)
Updates continuously with real-time feedback
"Sigen AI evaluates load forecasts, solar generation, and grid conditions in real time to optimize dispatch decisions"

Your System:

Hourly planning cycle (re-plans every hour)
Reactive to current consumption
No true forecasting - uses historical percentiles only
Missing: Weather integration for consumption prediction (heating/cooling)

Key Quote from sigen.txt:

"The AI forecasts your future energy needs and the future solar production (using weather data) along with known price forecasts. Using these, it effectively solves an optimization problem: maximize savings or profits over the coming day while meeting the home's needs and respecting battery limits."

2. LEARNING & ADAPTATION
Sigenergy:

Continuous learning - "the longer the system operates, the smarter it gets"
Takes ~7 days initial training period to build household profile
Machine learning models that improve prediction accuracy over time
Adapts to seasonal changes, new devices, pattern shifts

Your System:

Static statistical analysis (percentiles from historical data)
No learning loop - same logic every time
Doesn't adapt when patterns change (e.g., new EV, heat pump behavior change)
Missing: Feedback mechanism to improve predictions

Key Quote:

"After the day, use the actual vs predicted data to refine the models. For example, if the forecast overestimated evening load, the AI 'learns' and might adjust its model for next time. Over weeks, this training process makes the predictions and decisions increasingly accurate for that specific household."

3. OPTIMIZATION APPROACH
Sigenergy:

Global optimization across 24 hours
Considers ALL constraints simultaneously:

Battery capacity/power limits
Backup reserve requirements
Peak shaving windows (E.ON hours)
Arbitrage opportunities
Self-consumption goals


Uses optimization algorithms (likely LP/MIP or RL)

Your System:

Greedy/Local optimization - decides hour by hour
Agents compete, orchestrator resolves conflicts
No look-ahead beyond current hour (except proactive peak check)
Can make suboptimal trades (e.g., charge at 0.45 SEK, miss 0.35 SEK opportunity at 4 AM)

Key Insight from sigen.txt:

"By considering the whole upcoming day, it avoids, for example, discharging too early and having no energy left for a later peak price, or over-charging and wasting solar potential. This strategic scheduling is a step beyond simple rules."

4. HANDLING UNPREDICTABLE SPIKES
Sigenergy:

Probabilistic approach - doesn't try to predict exact spike timing
Maintains dynamic reserves based on:

Historical spike probability by hour
Weather forecasts (affect heating/cooling spikes)
Known usage patterns (EV charging schedules)


Real-time closed-loop feedback adjusts plan mid-execution

Your System:

Percentile-based reserves (correct approach!)
BUT: Doesn't adjust plan based on actual consumption vs forecast
Missing: Real-time replanning when consumption deviates from expected
Battery fills too much at night, can't respond to morning spikes

From sigen.txt:

"Execution with Feedback: As the day unfolds, measure actual solar and load vs. forecast. Adjust the plan if needed (e.g., if solar is over-performing, maybe charge the battery a bit earlier or push some energy to the evening)."

5. PEAK SHAVING STRATEGY
Sigenergy:

Pre-charges battery during off-peak specifically for upcoming peak windows
Weather-aware: If cold night expected → charge more for morning heating spike
"learns from usage patterns" - knows YOUR typical peak hours
Proactive: Begins discharge BEFORE peak, not during

Your System:

Reactive: Waits for consumption to exceed threshold
No pre-positioning of battery charge for known peak windows
Treats every E.ON hour equally (should prioritize 17-21 more)

Key Quote:

"Using this knowledge, the system will pre-charge the battery during cheaper off-peak times and automatically switch the house to battery power during the peak-rate window. In effect, the battery shaves off the peaks in demand by supplying stored energy when grid power cost is highest."

6. INTEGRATION & DATA SOURCES
Sigenergy:

Weather API integration (solar, temperature for HVAC prediction)
Real-time pricing from cloud
EV charger coordination
Smart appliance integration (can defer loads)
Device-Edge-Cloud architecture (fast local control + cloud optimization)

Your System:

Only Tibber consumption + Nordpool prices
No weather integration
No EV coordination
Pure simulation (not real-time control)

7. PLANNING HORIZON
Sigenergy:

24-48 hour planning horizon
Can reserve capacity TODAY for known peak TOMORROW
Multi-day optimization during extreme price events

Your System:

Effectively 1-hour planning horizon
Each hour decided independently
No ability to "save" battery for tomorrow's known expensive period


What Sigenergy Does BETTER (You Should Copy)
1. Daily Planning Cycle (Most Important)
Replace your hourly planning with:
python# At 13:00 each day (when next-day prices are known):
def create_24h_optimal_plan(self, context):
    """
    Solve optimization problem for next 24 hours.
    
    Inputs:
    - 24h price forecast
    - 24h consumption forecast (ML model or historical average)
    - 24h solar forecast
    - Current battery SOC
    - Peak threshold for month
    
    Outputs:
    - Hour-by-hour charge/discharge schedule
    - Expected final SOC
    - Expected savings
    """
    # This is an LP/MIP problem:
    # Minimize: Total_Cost = Σ(grid_import * price) + penalty_for_peaks
    # Subject to:
    #   - Battery capacity constraints
    #   - Power limits
    #   - SOC limits
    #   - Energy balance: consumption = grid + battery_discharge - battery_charge
    
    # Use scipy.optimize or pulp library
2. Learning Component
Add after each day:
pythondef update_consumption_model(self, actual_consumption, predicted_consumption):
    """
    Learn from prediction errors.
    
    If we consistently over-predict hour 18 consumption by 20%,
    adjust the model to predict lower next time.
    """
    error = actual_consumption - predicted_consumption
    
    # Update hourly adjustment factors
    self.hourly_bias[hour] = 0.9 * self.hourly_bias[hour] + 0.1 * error
    
    # Retrain ML model weekly with new data
    if days_since_training > 7:
        self.retrain_consumption_predictor()
3. Proactive Pre-positioning
Instead of reacting to peaks:
python# At 13:00 planning phase:
# "I know hour 18-20 historically has peaks. Current threshold is 9.5 kW."
# "I'll ensure battery has 8 kWh available at 17:30 by:"
#   1. Charging fully at night (cheap prices)
#   2. NOT discharging during day (save for peak window)
#   3. Begin gentle discharge at 17:00 (preemptive)
4. Weather Integration
pythondef get_consumption_forecast_with_weather(self):
    """
    Adjust consumption forecast based on weather.
    
    Cold day (-5°C) → +30% consumption (heating)
    Hot day (30°C) → +20% consumption (AC)
    Sunny day → -10% consumption (passive solar heating)
    """
    base_forecast = self.get_historical_average()
    weather = get_weather_forecast()
    
    # Adjust for temperature
    if weather.temp < 0:
        heating_load = (0 - weather.temp) * 0.5  # 0.5 kW per degree below 0
        base_forecast += heating_load
    
    return base_forecast

What YOUR System Does BETTER
1. Transparency & Explainability
Your multi-agent approach with reasoning strings is more debuggable than Sigenergy's black-box ML.
2. Flexibility
Easy to add new agents, tune parameters, enable/disable features. Sigenergy's system is proprietary/fixed.
3. Cost
Your system can run with zero AI costs (pure algorithms). Sigenergy requires cloud connectivity and potentially subscription fees.

RECOMMENDED HYBRID APPROACH
Combine the best of both:
pythonclass HybridBatteryOptimizer:
    """
    Sigenergy-inspired optimization with multi-agent flexibility.
    """
    
    def plan_day(self, timestamp):
        """Called at 13:00 when next-day prices available."""

        price_forecast = self.get_price_forecast(timestamp)
        
        # 2. OPTIMIZATION (Sigenergy approach)
        optimal_schedule = self.optimize_24h(
            consumption_forecast,
            solar_forecast,
            price_forecast,
            current_soc=self.battery.soc,
            peak_threshold=self.peak_tracker.get_threshold()
        )
        
        # 3. AGENT VALIDATION (Your approach)
        # Let specialist agents review the plan
        peak_agent_review = self.peak_agent.validate_plan(optimal_schedule)
        arbitrage_agent_review = self.arbitrage_agent.validate_plan(optimal_schedule)
        
        # 4. CONFLICT RESOLUTION (Your approach)
        if peak_agent_review.has_concerns or arbitrage_agent_review.has_concerns:
            # Orchestrator resolves, maybe re-optimize with new constraints
            final_plan = self.orchestrator.resolve(
                optimal_schedule,
                [peak_agent_review, arbitrage_agent_review]
            )
        else:
            final_plan = optimal_schedule
        
        return final_plan
    
    def execute_hour(self, hour):
        """Execute planned action, with real-time adjustments."""
        
        planned_action = self.daily_plan[hour]
        actual_consumption = self.measure_current_consumption()
        
        # 5. REAL-TIME OVERRIDE (Sigenergy approach)
        if actual_consumption > planned_consumption * 1.3:
            # Spike detected! Override plan
            emergency_discharge = self.peak_agent.emergency_response(actual_consumption)
            self.execute(emergency_discharge)
        else:
            # Follow plan
            self.execute(planned_action)
    
    def learn(self, day_results):
        """Update models based on actual performance."""
        
        # 6. LEARNING (Sigenergy approach)
        self.ml_predictor.update(
            predicted=day_results['forecast'],
            actual=day_results['actual']
        )

        self.peak_agent.record_performance(day_results)
        self.arbitrage_agent.record_performance(day_results)
